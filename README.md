# MLflow Operator

A Kubernetes operator for managing MLflow deployments on OpenShift and Kubernetes.

## Description

The MLflow Operator automates the deployment and lifecycle management of MLflow on Kubernetes and OpenShift clusters. It uses Helm charts internally to render and apply Kubernetes manifests, providing a declarative API for MLflow configuration through Custom Resources.

### Key Features

- **Declarative Configuration**: Define MLflow deployments via Kubernetes Custom Resources
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Works on both Kubernetes and OpenShift
- **Dual Deployment Modes**: Supports RHOAI and OpenDataHub deployment modes
- **Helm Chart Based**: Uses Helm charts that can be deployed standalone or via the operator
- **Environment Variable Passthrough**: Easy configuration of MLflow environment variables
- **Built-in Kubernetes Auth**: MLflow `kubernetes-auth` with `self_subject_access_review` and in-pod TLS termination
- **OpenShift Integration**: Automatic TLS certificate provisioning via service-ca-operator
- **Flexible Storage**: Support for local PVC, remote databases (PostgreSQL), and remote artifact storage (S3, etc.)
- **Read-Replica Routing**: Route supported metadata reads to an optional SQL read replica while writes remain on the primary database
- **Persistent Storage**: Automatic PVC creation with configurable size and storage class
- **Operator-Managed Database Migrations**: The operator can scale MLflow down, run a one-shot migration Job, and restore replicas during upgrades

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.24.6+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

### Deployment Modes

The operator supports two deployment modes:

- **RHOAI Mode** (`--mode=rhoai`): Deploys to `redhat-ods-applications` namespace
- **OpenDataHub Mode** (`--mode=opendatahub`): Deploys to `opendatahub` namespace (default)

### To Deploy on the cluster

**Option 1: Using kustomize overlays (Recommended)**

For RHOAI mode:
```sh
kustomize build config/overlays/rhoai | kubectl apply -f -
```

For OpenDataHub mode:
```sh
kustomize build config/overlays/odh | kubectl apply -f -
```

**Option 2: Build and deploy from source**

Build and push your image:
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/mlflow-operator:tag
```

> **Building on Apple Silicon**: Use `docker-buildx` with CGO disabled to avoid QEMU emulation issues:
>
> ```sh
> CGO_ENABLED=0 PLATFORMS=linux/amd64 make docker-buildx IMG=<some-registry>/mlflow-operator:tag
> ```
>
> This builds without FIPS support, which is acceptable for local development. Production images are built on amd64 CI runners with FIPS enabled.

Install the CRDs:
```sh
make install
```

Deploy the operator:
```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/mlflow-operator:tag
```

`make deploy` uses the local-development overlay in `.github/test-infra/overlays/dev`. Shipped operator manifests for standalone and ODH/RHOAI installs remain under `config/`.

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need cluster-admin privileges.

**Option 3: Deploy to Open Data Hub or Red Hat OpenShift AI platform**

If Open Data Hub (ODH) or Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI) is already installed on your cluster, you can use the `deploy-to-platform` target. This command automatically fetches the gateway hostname from the cluster and configures the operator to use it:

```sh
make deploy-to-platform IMG=<some-registry>/mlflow-operator:tag PLATFORM=rhoai # or PLATFORM=odh by default
```

This command:
1. Fetches the data-science-gateway hostname from the `openshift-ingress` namespace
2. Updates the `mlflow-url` in `config/base/params.env` to use `https://<gateway-hostname>`
3. Deploys the operator with the correct gateway configuration

> **IMPORTANT**: The ODH/RHOAI gateway must already exist for the HTTPRoute to work correctly. This target is only for clusters where ODH or RHOAI is already installed and the `data-science-gateway` Gateway resource is present.

You can customize the gateway name and namespace if needed:
```sh
make deploy-to-platform ODH_GATEWAY_NAME=my-gateway ODH_GATEWAY_NAMESPACE=my-namespace IMG=<some-registry>/mlflow-operator:tag
```

### MLflowOperator module handoff

`mlflow-operator` now also carries the cluster-scoped singleton `MLflowOperator` API at `components.platform.opendatahub.io/v1alpha1`. The corresponding controller path is guarded by `ENABLE_MLFLOW_OPERATOR_MODULE_CONTROLLER` and remains disabled by default so releases can ship safely before the coordinating ODH module-handler change lands. If that flag is enabled, startup now treats the `MLflowOperator` CRD as required: the operator waits up to `MLFLOW_OPERATOR_MODULE_CONTROLLER_CRD_WAIT_TIMEOUT` for the CRD to appear and fails startup if the timeout expires, rather than silently skipping controller registration.

When that toggle is disabled, legacy platform behavior continues to rely on the existing env/flag contract such as `MLFLOW_URL`, `GATEWAY_NAME`, and `--namespace`. When it is enabled, additive modular inputs are also honored:

- `APPLICATIONS_NAMESPACE` for startup-time operand targeting
- `RELATED_IMAGE_ODH_MLFLOW_IMAGE` for the default MLflow runtime image
- the singleton `MLflowOperator` spec for projected platform fields such as gateway domain

`APPLICATIONS_NAMESPACE` is consumed directly from the operator Deployment so the process, cache, and namespace-scoped RBAC all agree on one target namespace. The `MLflowOperator` CR no longer carries a separate `applicationsNamespace` field.

`RELATED_IMAGE_ODH_MLFLOW_IMAGE` is only the platform override. The vendored `MLFLOW_IMAGE` default in `config/base/params.env` remains the operator's baseline fallback and is still expected to exist for standalone and non-ODH deployment paths.

**Option 4: Deploy to local Kind cluster**

For local development and testing, you can deploy the MLflow operator to a Kind (Kubernetes IN Docker) cluster with various storage backend configurations:

```sh
# Deploy with default configuration (SQLite + file storage)
make deploy-kind

# Override the default MLflow image when needed
MLFLOW_IMAGE=my-registry/mlflow:custom-tag make deploy-kind
```

The Kind/PostgreSQL/SeaweedFS manifests used by this workflow live under `.github/test-infra/` so container scanners do not treat those CI-only assets as part of the shipped `config/` install bundle.

For detailed instructions, advanced configuration options, and troubleshooting, see the [Kind Deployment Guide](docs/kind-deployment.md).

**Create MLflow instances**

> **NOTE**: The target namespace must already exist. The operator does not create namespaces.

Apply the sample MLflow CR:
```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/mlflow_v1_mlflow.yaml
```

The operator will automatically:
- Deploy MLflow with the specified configuration
- Set up persistent storage (PVC) if configured
- Create ServiceAccount, RBAC resources (ClusterRole, ClusterRoleBinding)
- Configure TLS certificates (OpenShift service-ca or manual)
- Run MLflow with Kubernetes auth enabled and TLS termination in-process
- Update the CR status with deployment readiness and access URLs

You can inspect the published MLflow endpoints directly from the custom resource status:

```sh
kubectl get mlflow mlflow -o jsonpath='{.status.url}{"\n"}{.status.artifactsUrl}{"\n"}{.status.address.url}{"\n"}'
```

- `status.url` is the external MLflow URL exposed through the data science gateway when Gateway API support is available
- `status.artifactsUrl` is the external artifact API root and is published only when the dedicated artifact server is enabled
- `status.address.url` is the in-cluster HTTPS URL for the managed MLflow `Service`

### Standalone Helm Deployment

You can also deploy MLflow directly using Helm without the operator:

```sh
cd charts/mlflow
helm install mlflow . -n opendatahub --create-namespace
```

Customize values:
```sh
helm install mlflow . -n opendatahub --create-namespace \
  --set image.tag=v2.0.0 \
  --set storage.accessMode=ReadWriteOnce \
  --set storage.size=20Gi
```

The standalone Helm chart does not orchestrate MLflow database migrations. Bootstrap or migrate the database yourself before rolling out a standalone Helm upgrade.
When enabling the dedicated artifact server, `artifactsServer.allowedHosts` defaults to `["*"]`
so external Gateway Host headers are accepted. Production installs should replace the wildcard
with their Gateway hostname or hostnames; see [`charts/mlflow/README.md`](charts/mlflow/README.md).

## Configuration

### Authentication and Security

MLflow is deployed with the `kubernetes-auth` app enabled. The operator sets `MLFLOW_K8S_AUTH_AUTHORIZATION_MODE=self_subject_access_review`, so authorization checks are performed directly by MLflow using the caller's token. The MLflow server itself still runs under a shared `mlflow` ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding so the workspace provider can enumerate namespaces and watch the shared `mlflow-artifact-connection` secret plus `MLflowConfig` overrides across workspaces.

The deployment always sets `MLFLOW_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true` and `MLFLOW_SERVER_ENABLE_JOB_EXECUTION=false` to disable telemetry and server-side job execution. When trace archival is enabled, archival runs via a separate CronJob rather than the server's built-in scheduler; the server still receives the archival config so the UI can surface archival status.

TLS is terminated inside the MLflow container using uvicorn options. Certificates come from the `mlflow-tls` secret, which is created automatically on OpenShift via the `service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name` annotation. If you need to provide your own certificates, place `tls.crt` and `tls.key` in a secret named `mlflow-tls` (or override `tls.secretName` in Helm values). On OpenShift, the operator sets `UVICORN_SSL_CIPHERS=PROFILE=SYSTEM` by default unless `spec.env` already defines that variable, so uvicorn follows the platform crypto policy, including FIPS-compatible TLS 1.2 and 1.3 cipher selection.

The operator watches Secrets in its target namespace and filters events to the Secrets referenced by the MLflow server (`mlflow-tls`, database URI references, `spec.env`, and `spec.envFrom`). It records their resource versions in the operator-managed `mlflow.opendatahub.io/secret-resource-versions` pod-template annotation, so rotating a referenced Secret triggers a standard Deployment rollout. Do not set this annotation in `spec.podAnnotations`; the operator owns its value.

When garbage collection is enabled, the CronJob runs under a separate `mlflow-gc-sa` ServiceAccount with its own suffixed `mlflow-gc{{ resourceSuffix }}` ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding. The retained `experiments/update` permission is only needed when artifact deletion still goes through the MLflow artifact proxy; metadata cleanup itself uses the backend store directly.

### Operator RBAC Privileges

The operator requires two levels of RBAC permissions:

- **Cluster-scoped** (`config/rbac/role.yaml`): Manages the MLflow custom resource lifecycle, enumerates namespaces, reads and watches the well-known artifact storage secret, watches MLflowConfig overrides, manages the shared `mlflow` ClusterRole/ClusterRoleBinding plus the currently effective singleton `mlflow-gc` RBAC names, and handles OpenShift console links and Gateway API routes. 
- **Namespace-scoped** (`config/rbac/namespace_role.yaml`): 
  The MLflow Controller manages deployment resources (ConfigMaps, Secrets, ServiceAccounts, Services, PVCs, Deployments, NetworkPolicies, ServiceMonitors) within the target namespace.

  When `ENABLE_NAMESPACE_RBAC` is set, the Namespace RBAC Controller watches labeled namespaces and reconciles `odh-group-mlflow-view` and `odh-group-mlflow-edit` RoleBindings in each. Subjects are read from the Auth CR. Removing the label removes these RoleBindings; updating the Auth CR re-reconciles subjects automatically.

  The operator also creates shared `mlflow` ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding objects for the MLflow server pod itself, granting read-only cluster-wide access to namespaces, the well-known `mlflow-artifact-connection` secret, and MLflowConfig CRs. Secret access includes watch-based reads so namespace-specific artifact override updates can be observed across workspaces. These cannot be scoped to a single namespace because MLflow serves requests across namespaces.

See the manifest files for detailed per-resource documentation.

### Storage Configuration

`backendStoreUri` (or `backendStoreUriFrom`) is required on new creates and updates. Inline `backendStoreUri` and `registryStoreUri` intentionally accept only the documented SQL schemes (`sqlite://` and `postgresql://`). To avoid breaking already-stored CRs created before this validation was introduced, the operator still falls back to the legacy implicit SQLite backend during reconciliation when both fields are unset.

#### Local Storage (Development/Testing)
```yaml
spec:
  storage:
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 10Gi
    storageClassName: ""  # Use default storage class
  backendStoreUri: "sqlite:////mlflow/mlflow.db"
  registryStoreUri: "sqlite:////mlflow/mlflow.db"
  artifactsDestination: "file:///mlflow/artifacts"
  serveArtifacts: true
```

Once `spec.storage` is configured, it and its access modes cannot be changed or removed in place because the existing PVC is retained and its access modes are immutable. Preserve any required data and recreate the MLflow resource and PVC to use a different access mode. Older resources that omitted access modes may normalize them once to `ReadWriteOnce`, matching the operator's legacy default.

Multiple tracking replicas require `ReadWriteMany` when they use the PVC for SQLite, a secret-backed metadata store whose scheme cannot be inspected, or locally served artifacts. A configured but otherwise unused RWO PVC does not prevent scaling tracking pods that use remote stores.

#### Remote Storage (Production)
```yaml
spec:
  # No storage PVC needed - using remote PostgreSQL and S3

  # Use secret references for database URIs containing credentials (recommended)
  backendStoreUriFrom:
    name: mlflow-db-credentials
    key: backend-store-uri  # postgresql://user:password@host:5432/dbname

  registryStoreUriFrom:
    name: mlflow-db-credentials
    key: registry-store-uri  # postgresql://user:password@host:5432/dbname

  readReplicaBackendStoreUriFrom:
    name: mlflow-db-credentials
    key: read-replica-backend-store-uri  # postgresql://user:password@reader:5432/dbname

  artifactsDestination: "s3://my-mlflow-bucket/artifacts"
  defaultArtifactRoot: "s3://my-mlflow-bucket/artifacts/runs"
  serveArtifacts: true

  # Optional: increase writable /tmp capacity for proxied artifact serving.
  # The operator/chart default is 1Gi.
  temporaryStorage:
    sizeLimit: 2Gi

  # S3 credentials via secret
  envFrom:
    - secretRef:
        name: aws-credentials  # Contains AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

  env:
    - name: AWS_DEFAULT_REGION
      value: us-east-1
```

`spec.env` and `spec.envFrom` are applied to the MLflow Deployment, the garbage collection CronJob, and the trace-archival CronJob so S3 region, endpoint, and credential configuration stay consistent across those workloads.

To use cloud-native workload identity instead of static access keys (for example AWS IRSA on ROSA or EKS), set `spec.serviceAccountAnnotations` on the MLflow CR. Those annotations are applied to the main `mlflow-sa` ServiceAccount and, when enabled, to `mlflow-gc-sa` and `mlflow-trace-archival-sa`:

```yaml
spec:
  artifactsDestination: "s3://my-mlflow-bucket/artifacts"
  serveArtifacts: true
  serviceAccountAnnotations:
    eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/mlflow-s3
  env:
    - name: AWS_DEFAULT_REGION
      value: us-east-1
```

Standalone Helm installs can set the same annotations under `serviceAccount.annotations`, `garbageCollection.serviceAccount.annotations`, and `traceArchival.serviceAccount.annotations`.

Create the database credentials secret:
```bash
# Create secret with database URIs
kubectl create secret generic mlflow-db-credentials \
  --from-literal=backend-store-uri='postgresql://mlflow:password@postgres.example.com:5432/mlflow' \
  --from-literal=registry-store-uri='postgresql://mlflow:password@postgres.example.com:5432/mlflow' \
  --from-literal=read-replica-backend-store-uri='postgresql://mlflow:password@postgres-reader.example.com:5432/mlflow' \
  -n <namespace>
```

When serving artifacts through the tracking or dedicated artifact server against remote storage
such as S3, MLflow can spool artifact bytes through `/tmp` during proxied upload/download flows. Use
`spec.temporaryStorage.sizeLimit` to raise that writable `emptyDir` above the 1Gi default
for deployments that expect larger or more concurrent artifact transfers.

### Read-Replica Backend Routing

MLflow 3.14 and later can route supported tracking and model-registry reads to one optional SQL read replica. Configure either the direct URI or the Secret-backed form; do not set both:

```yaml
spec:
  backendStoreUriFrom:
    name: mlflow-db-credentials
    key: backend-store-uri
  readReplicaBackendStoreUriFrom:
    name: mlflow-db-credentials
    key: read-replica-backend-store-uri
```

For development configurations without credentials, use `readReplicaBackendStoreUri` directly. When neither read-replica field is set, MLflow continues to send all reads and writes to the primary backend, preserving existing single-backend behavior.

MLflow uses one replica URI for supported tracking and model-registry reads, while writes continue to use the primary stores. Configure the replica only when it has a compatible schema and can serve both stores. Replica availability and read consistency are determined by the database topology.

### Dynamic Resource Allocation

Use `spec.resourceClaims` for pod-level Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) claims, then reference those claims from `spec.resources.claims` so the MLflow container can consume the allocated resource:

```yaml
spec:
  resourceClaims:
    - name: shared-gpu
      resourceClaimTemplateName: shared-gpu-template
  resources:
    claims:
      - name: shared-gpu
        request: gpu
```

`resourceClaims` is optional and requires the Kubernetes `DynamicResourceAllocation` feature gate when running on clusters that still gate the field.
For each `spec.resourceClaims[]` entry, set exactly one non-empty value:
- `resourceClaimName` to reference an existing claim
- `resourceClaimTemplateName` to create a claim from a template

Setting both, neither, or an empty string value is rejected by CRD validation.

Dedicated artifact pods use `spec.artifactsServer.resourceClaims` with matching
`spec.artifactsServer.resources.claims` references. They do not inherit tracking pod claims because
a claim cannot generally be consumed by both workloads. When artifact resources are omitted,
tracking requests and limits are inherited without claim references.

### Database Migration

Use `spec.migration.mode` to control operator-managed database migration orchestration:

- `Automatic` (default) runs the migration Job on bootstrap and whenever `status.version` differs from the operator-supported MLflow version
- `Always` runs the migration Job for each new desired generation, meaning each new revision of the MLflow resource after its desired state changes, before the MLflow Deployment is scaled back up
- `spec.migration.ttlSecondsAfterFinished` optionally overrides how long finished migration Jobs are retained before Kubernetes TTL cleanup may delete them; when omitted, the operator defaults to 86400 seconds (24 hours), and values below 3600 seconds (1 hour) are rejected

`status.version` records the supported MLflow version that most recently completed the operator-managed migration flow. The `Migration` status condition records the per-generation migration state using `observedGeneration`: `Unknown` while migration is in progress or retrying after a transient failure, `True` after success, and `False` after a terminal failure.

Operator-managed migration only supports documented SQL metadata store URIs for the backend and registry stores: `sqlite://` and `postgresql://`. Inline `file://` backend or registry metadata URIs are intentionally rejected, and `file://` metadata stores are not supported for operator-managed migration.

If `spec.image.image` overrides the operator-configured image, the operator still uses that image for the migration Job. This supports hotfix and test images, but it also means the operator does not prevalidate the custom image's migration runtime contract before scale-down, so an incompatible custom image can still fail after the MLflow Deployment has been scaled down and cause downtime.

The operator keeps Kubernetes Job retries finite, but it automatically recreates fresh migration Jobs after a short delay for retryable failures such as transient database connectivity issues. Terminal failures, such as version mismatches, unsupported metadata store URIs, or known Alembic revision-resolution errors, stop automatic retries and instruct the admin to use `mlflow.opendatahub.io/force-migrate` after fixing the issue.

To trigger a manual one-shot rerun, add the presence-based `mlflow.opendatahub.io/force-migrate` annotation to the MLflow resource. After a successful forced migration, the operator clears the annotation automatically. If a finished Job already exists for the current desired generation, the operator deletes it first so it can create the replacement Job with the same generated name.

By default, finished migration Jobs remain visible for 24 hours before TTL cleanup may remove them. This means upgrades can leave a completed migration Job behind briefly in shared namespaces such as `redhat-ods-applications`, which gives admins time to inspect logs when needed.

During the migration flow, the operator resolves the final MLflow image, scales the MLflow Deployment to zero, waits for all MLflow replicas to disappear, runs a one-shot Job against the backend and registry stores, verifies that the migration image reports the supported MLflow version, restores the requested replica count, and updates `status.version` only after the post-migration rollout is ready.
The migration Job explicitly disables `MLFLOW_READ_REPLICA_BACKEND_STORE_URI`, so schema changes never target the read replica.
For ODH/RHOAI MLflow images that ship `mlflow.store.db.migration_gap`, that Job also runs the backend-only RHOAI `3.3 -> 3.4` gap repair before the generic MLflow migration logic.

### Trace Archival

The operator supports trace archival, which moves older trace span payloads from the SQL tracking store to a configured artifact location while keeping traces readable in the UI and APIs. Archival runs via a CronJob that executes the standalone archival module, following the same pattern as garbage collection.

```yaml
spec:
  backendStoreUriFrom:
    name: mlflow-db-credentials
    key: backend-store-uri
  serveArtifacts: true
  artifactsDestination: "s3://mlflow-artifacts"
  traceArchival:
    enabled: true
    schedule: "0 */6 * * *"
    location: "s3://mlflow-trace-archive"
    retention: "30d"
    maxTracesPerPass: 1000
    longRetentionAllowlist:
      - "12345"
```

When `traceArchival.enabled` is true, the operator:
- Generates a `mlflow-trace-archival-config` ConfigMap and mounts it into both the MLflow server (for UI awareness via `/server-info`) and the CronJob (for execution)
- Creates a CronJob (`mlflow-trace-archival`) with `concurrencyPolicy: Forbid` that runs the standalone archival module on the configured schedule
- The MLflow server's built-in scheduler stays disabled (`MLFLOW_SERVER_ENABLE_JOB_EXECUTION=false`); the CronJob handles archival externally, which avoids multi-replica coordination entirely
- The CronJob uses the `mlflow-trace-archival-sa` ServiceAccount

A `file://` archival location shares persistent storage with the MLflow workload and therefore requires `storage.accessModes[0]` to be `ReadWriteMany`. Trace archival also requires `ReadWriteMany` when its CronJob shares PVC-backed metadata such as SQLite with the tracking pod. A Secret-backed metadata URI without `spec.storage` is treated as remote SQL and does not mount a PVC; when `spec.storage` is configured, its unknown scheme is handled conservatively as potentially local. If an existing deployment uses `ReadWriteOnce`, preserve its data and recreate the MLflow resource and PVC with `ReadWriteMany` before enabling trace archival; Kubernetes cannot change an existing PVC's access modes in place.

The repository's test deployer creates `ReadWriteOnce` storage whenever either metadata store is SQLite. It therefore enables its S3 trace-archival smoke configuration only when both the backend and registry stores use PostgreSQL; S3 matrix rows involving SQLite continue to test tracking and artifact behavior without deploying the archival CronJob.

When trace archival is disabled or the CR is deleted, the operator cleans up the CronJob, ConfigMap, and ServiceAccount.

See `config/samples/mlflow_v1_mlflow_trace_archival.yaml` for a complete example.

### Dedicated Artifact Server

Artifact traffic can be isolated from general tracking traffic by enabling a dedicated,
metadata-aware MLflow artifact server:

```yaml
spec:
  backendStoreUriFrom:
    name: mlflow-db-credentials
    key: backend-store-uri
  artifactsDestination: s3://mlflow-artifacts
  serveArtifacts: false
  temporaryStorage:
    sizeLimit: 2Gi
  artifactsServer:
    enabled: true
    replicas: 2
    workers: 2
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: 500m
        memory: 1Gi
```

The split topology requires the operator's external `MLFLOW_URL` to be configured and the
Gateway API `HTTPRoute` resource to be available. `artifactsDestination` must be set explicitly.
If the `HTTPRoute` API is unavailable, reconciliation rejects split serving before changing the
existing tracking workload or creating dedicated artifact resources.
It requires a remote SQL metadata store; inline SQLite backend, registry, and read-replica URIs
are rejected. Although CEL cannot inspect Secret values, the operator resolves every configured
`backendStoreUriFrom`, `registryStoreUriFrom`, and `readReplicaBackendStoreUriFrom` key through
the API before rendering or mutating operands. Missing Secrets or keys and values that are not
remote PostgreSQL or MySQL URIs fail reconciliation. For a `file://` artifact destination, one
artifact replica may use `ReadWriteOnce`; multiple artifact replicas require `ReadWriteMany` as
the first storage access mode. The operator creates:

- The normal `mlflow` tracking Deployment, Service, and `/mlflow` HTTPRoute
- An `mlflow-artifacts` Deployment running with `--serve-artifacts`, the same metadata-store
  configuration as tracking, and `MLFLOW_SERVER_ENABLE_JOB_EXECUTION=false`
- An `mlflow-artifacts` Service and `/mlflow-artifacts` HTTPRoute
- A separate `mlflow-artifacts-tls` serving-certificate request on OpenShift; on other
  Kubernetes distributions, provide that Secret before enabling the feature

The tracking server runs with `--no-serve-artifacts`, and both metadata-connected servers use
`<MLFLOW_URL>/mlflow-artifacts/api/2.0/mlflow-artifacts/artifacts` as their default artifact
root, so `spec.defaultArtifactRoot` must be omitted in this mode. MLflow clients therefore continue to use the tracking server for metadata while sending
artifact uploads and downloads to the dedicated route. The tracking Deployment does not mount
`spec.storage` in this mode; a file-backed destination is mounted only by the artifact Deployment.
Experiments created before split serving may retain `mlflow-artifacts:/` artifact locations. The
artifact HTTPRoute also matches their complete tracking-relative `/mlflow/api/2.0/mlflow-artifacts`
and `/mlflow/ajax-api/2.0/mlflow-artifacts` proxy families and rewrites them to the dedicated route.
This includes artifact transfer, multipart upload, and presigned-download requests, so enabling split
serving does not require rewriting existing experiment or run metadata. Per-resource suffixes are
preserved on both paths.
The artifact HTTPRoute also rewrites the narrow set of tracking-relative UI handlers that require
metadata to resolve artifact locations: run and model-version downloads, artifact listing and
upload, trace artifacts, and logged-model artifact operations. All other `/mlflow` traffic remains
on the tracking Service except for the logged-model route family. Gateway API cannot match a
wildcard model ID in the middle of a path, so the logged-model rule uses the narrowest portable
prefix ending at `/logged-models/`; consequently, non-artifact logged-model requests under that
prefix also reach the metadata-aware artifact Deployment.

`spec.temporaryStorage.sizeLimit` configures the writable `/tmp` `emptyDir` for both the
tracking and artifact-serving pods; increase it for larger or more concurrent proxied transfers.

Both deployments use `kubernetes://` as the workspace provider and Kubernetes authorization.
They share the image, ServiceAccount, workspace label selector, artifact credentials, CA bundles,
security contexts, scheduling configuration, and primary/registry/read-replica metadata URIs.
When metrics are enabled, the `ServiceMonitor` selects only the tracking Service because only the
tracking server runs with `--expose-prometheus`; the artifact Service retains the shared `app` label
for operator cache membership without becoming a scrape target.
This metadata-aware deployment is a short-term compatibility topology for UI artifact handlers;
server-side job execution is disabled in both deployments to avoid duplicate background work.
The shared CA configuration includes PostgreSQL and MySQL client settings as well as HTTP and S3,
keeping standalone chart deployments with SQL-backed artifact workspace stores TLS-compatible.
`artifactsServer.replicas`,
`artifactsServer.workers`, and `artifactsServer.resources` can scale artifact processing
independently; artifact resources inherit the main server resources when omitted. `serveArtifacts` and
`artifactsServer.enabled` cannot both be enabled.

The operator GitHub Kind workflow runs independent PostgreSQL/file and PostgreSQL/S3 jobs. Both
install the `HTTPRoute` CRD before operator startup, provide the dedicated TLS Secret, and
port-forward the artifact Service to validate authenticated, workspace-scoped uploads, listing,
and downloads. The S3 job additionally validates multipart create/abort. A Gateway controller is
not required for that functional coverage.

For a direct local Kind run, install the CRD before the operator starts (or restart the operator
after installing it), then run the dedicated smoke coverage:

```bash
kubectl apply -f test/crd/httproutes.gateway.networking.k8s.io.yaml
ARTIFACTS_SERVER=true \
ARTIFACT_BACKENDS=file \
BACKEND_STORE=postgres \
REGISTRY_STORE=postgres \
INFRASTRUCTURE_PLATFORM=base \
mlflow-tests/images/test-run.sh -m "smoke and artifacts_server"
```

Use `ARTIFACT_BACKENDS=s3` to include multipart API coverage, or `file,s3` to run both backends
sequentially. Upgrade and preserved-resource runs still require exactly one artifact backend.

Live compatibility validation remains OpenShift-specific. It sends tracking-relative UI and
multipart requests through the configured Gateway and verifies from access logs that the Gateway
rewrote them to the artifact Deployment:

```bash
ARTIFACTS_SERVER=true \
ARTIFACTS_SERVER_GATEWAY=true \
ARTIFACT_BACKENDS=s3 \
BACKEND_STORE=postgres \
REGISTRY_STORE=postgres \
INFRASTRUCTURE_PLATFORM=openshift \
mlflow-tests/images/test-run.sh -m "smoke and artifacts_server"
```

Kind skips only the Gateway acceptance, route-precedence, and rewrite assertions.

The artifact server validates `X-MLFLOW-WORKSPACE` and resolves metadata in the request workspace.
A namespace-specific `MLflowConfig.spec.artifactRootSecret` remains a direct storage override:
experiments in that workspace receive the configured object-storage URI and bypass the shared
artifact proxy. The artifact server has one global
`artifactsDestination` and does not dynamically select per-namespace storage credentials.

Operator-managed migrations scale both metadata-connected Deployments to zero and wait until all
their replicas disappear before creating the migration Job. If split serving is disabled in the
same desired generation, cleanup of the old artifact Deployment is deferred until it has been
quiesced and the migration plus tracking rollout complete.

Disabling `artifactsServer` otherwise removes its Deployment, Service, and HTTPRoute. See
`config/samples/mlflow_v1_mlflow_artifacts_server.yaml` for a complete remote-storage example.

The garbage-collection CronJob resolves proxy-backed artifact locations through the internal
tracking Service normally and through the internal artifact Service in split mode. This
keeps historical `mlflow-artifacts:/` locations deletable after enabling the dedicated server
without depending on the external Gateway. The CronJob mounts persistent storage only when its
backend metadata URI may be local, so PostgreSQL with proxied remote artifacts does not attach an
unused PVC. Trace archival mounts storage for a `file://` archive location or configured storage
that may contain local metadata; Secret-backed remote SQL without `spec.storage` does not mount one.

### CORS Configuration

The operator automatically configures `MLFLOW_SERVER_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` with safe defaults:
- Kubernetes service names (short, namespaced, and FQDN forms)
- The data science gateway base URL (from `MLFLOW_URL`, or from the singleton `MLflowOperator` gateway projection when the module-controller handoff is enabled)
- `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` (for development and Kind integration tests)

To allow additional origins, use `extraAllowedOrigins` in the MLflow CR:
```yaml
spec:
  extraAllowedOrigins:
    - "https://my-app.example.com"
    - "https://jupyter.example.com:8888"
```

For standalone Helm deployments (without the operator), set `mlflow.corsAllowedOrigins` directly:
```sh
helm install mlflow . --set mlflow.corsAllowedOrigins="https://my-app.example.com,https://other.example.com"
```

### Network Security

The operator automatically creates a NetworkPolicy that:
- **Ingress**: Allows traffic to the MLflow HTTPS port (8443) from any pod in the cluster
- **Egress**: Allows DNS (ports 53 and 5353), HTTPS (ports 443, 6443, and 8443 to any destination), PostgreSQL (port 5432), MySQL (port 3306), and S3-compatible object storage (MinIO port 9000, SeaweedFS ports 8333 and 8334)

Use `networkPolicyAdditionalEgressRules` to append rules for non-default ports:
```yaml
spec:
  networkPolicyAdditionalEgressRules:
    - ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 15432
```

To replace the entire default egress block (for example, to restrict HTTPS to a specific CIDR), use `networkPolicyEgressRules`. The caller is responsible for including DNS and any other required rules:
```yaml
spec:
  networkPolicyEgressRules:
    - ports:
        - protocol: UDP
          port: 53
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 53
        - protocol: UDP
          port: 5353
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 5353
    - ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 443
      to:
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: 10.0.0.0/8
```

### Namespace Overrides (MLflowConfig)

`MLflowConfig` is a namespaced singleton used to override artifact storage settings for a namespace.
Use `apiVersion: mlflow.kubeflow.org/v1` for `MLflowConfig` resources.
The `metadata.name` must be `mlflow` in every namespace where you want to apply overrides.
The `spec.artifactRootSecret` must be `mlflow-artifact-connection` to keep Secret access tightly scoped.
The operator still installs this CRD as part of `make install` and the kustomize overlays, but it is now kept as a vendored local copy at `config/crd/mlflow.kubeflow.org_mlflowconfigs.yaml`, refreshed from the upstream `mlflow-kubernetes-plugins` repository.
The vendored upstream schema also validates `spec.artifactRootPath` more strictly: it must be relative, must not start with `/`, and must not contain `..` path segments.

### Custom CA Bundles

When connecting to external services that use self-signed certificates or private CAs (such as private S3 endpoints, PostgreSQL databases, or artifact stores), you can configure custom CA bundles.

The operator combines CA certificates from multiple sources into a single bundle:
1. **System CA bundle** - Base system certificates from the container image
2. **Platform CA bundle** - Automatically detected from `odh-trusted-ca-bundle` ConfigMap (injected by ODH/RHOAI)
3. **User-provided CA bundle** - Custom certificates you specify via `caBundleConfigMap`

#### Using a Custom CA Bundle

Create a ConfigMap containing your CA certificates (all `.crt` and `.pem` files will be included):
```bash
kubectl create configmap my-ca-bundle \
  --from-file=ca-bundle.crt=/path/to/your/ca-certificates.pem \
  -n <namespace>
```

Reference it in your MLflow CR:
```yaml
spec:
  caBundleConfigMap:
    name: my-ca-bundle
```

When CA bundles are present (platform or custom), PostgreSQL connections use `PGSSLMODE=verify-full`. Ensure your PostgreSQL server's certificate is signed by a CA in the bundle, or override via connection string (e.g., `?sslmode=prefer`).
### Example Configurations

See the [config/samples](./config/samples/) directory for complete examples:
- `mlflow_v1_mlflow.yaml` - OpenShift deployment with local storage, service-ca TLS, and a commented DRA example
- `mlflow_v1_mlflow_remote_storage.yaml` - PostgreSQL primary/read-replica routing + S3 storage with horizontal scaling and a temporary storage override for proxied artifact serving
- `mlflow_v1_mlflow_artifacts_server.yaml` - Split tracking and metadata-aware artifact-serving servers using PostgreSQL and S3
- `mlflow_v1_mlflowconfig.yaml` - Namespace-scoped artifact storage override using the upstream `MLflowConfig` CRD

## Development

For API and code-generation changes, use `make generate` and `make manifests`. The Makefile scopes `controller-gen` to the root controller package plus the nested `api/` module so unrelated nested repo copies or temp trees under the workspace do not affect generated output. Keep the Kubernetes dependency versions in the root module and `api/go.mod` aligned so generation runs against the same API types the operator binary uses.

## Testing

MLflow coverage is split between:

- Go end-to-end tests in `test/e2e/`, including the operator-managed upgrade flow
- Python integration tests in `mlflow-tests/`

Ginkgo e2e covers trace archival CEL validation and operator resource lifecycle/cleanup without waiting for a cron tick or starting a Job against dummy storage. `mlflow-tests` smoke coverage creates several traces, persists them as DB-backed spans via OTLP `/v1/traces` (OpenShift HTTPRoute rewrites `/mlflow/v1`; Kind uses the unprefixed pod path), waits past a short harness-configured retention, runs a live archival Job from the CronJob template on object storage (`s3` / `externals3`), and verifies both archive object creation and post-archive trace readability. Live `file://` archival Jobs are avoided because the default PVC is ReadWriteOnce.

For a repo-level map of Red Hat OpenShift AI MLflow fork validation, including
Jenkins shift-left smoke and upgrade coverage, see the
[RHOAI MLflow Fork Testing Guide](docs/rhoai-mlflow-testing.md).

`mlflow-tests` also includes opt-in upgrade-phase pytest modules under:

- `mlflow-tests/tests/upgrade/pre_upgrade/`
- `mlflow-tests/tests/upgrade/post_upgrade/`

Versioned files such as `test_3_10.py` run only when the applicable version threshold is at least `3.10`. `pre_upgrade` gates on `MLFLOW_TEST_SUPPORTED_VERSION`; `post_upgrade` gates on the pre-upgrade version recorded in the `mlflow-upgrade-test-version` ConfigMap in `upgrade_test_workspace`.

For local runs, `bash mlflow-tests/images/test-run.sh` derives `MLFLOW_TEST_SUPPORTED_VERSION` when needed, uses `upgrade_test_workspace` as the shared namespace and RBAC target for upgrade phases, and requires exactly one artifact backend for `pre_upgrade` or `post_upgrade`. The harness auto-selects `INFRASTRUCTURE_PLATFORM=openshift` only when `route.openshift.io` resources are actually present; otherwise it uses the generic `base` overlay, and you can still override `INFRASTRUCTURE_PLATFORM` explicitly if needed. On OpenShift, the harness uses the MLflow CR `status.url` gateway address by default, but `FORCE_PORT_FORWARD=true` forces the older localhost port-forward path when needed. The chart-managed MLflow pod now keeps its liveness probe on `/health` but uses `/api/3.0/mlflow/server-info` for readiness, matching the unauthenticated Kubernetes auth-plugin allowlist more closely to the workspace-aware client path. `mlflow-tests/images/test-run.sh` now first uses `kubectl wait --for=condition=Available --timeout=300s` on the MLflow CR and then polls the resolved `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` `/api/3.0/mlflow/server-info` endpoint for up to 3 minutes, and it runs `mlflow-tests/images/collect-debug-logs.sh` if pre-pytest readiness checks such as `status.url`, `Available`, `server-info`, or post-upgrade `status.version` time out so upgrade flakes preserve cluster evidence. The upgrade seeding action that creates the shared pre-upgrade experiment now retries setup failures with a short backoff and reuses the named experiment when `create_experiment` reports that it already exists. Seeded `pre_upgrade` runs against source MLflow versions before `3.12` must use tracking URIs without the `/mlflow` static prefix, while `post_upgrade` and current-version runs still use the prefixed `/mlflow` API path. A missing post-upgrade handoff ConfigMap still means there is no matching versioned dataset for that upgrade source and now exits cleanly as a successful skip, while malformed ConfigMap contents still fail fast. For normal current-version multi-backend runs, `test-run.sh` now tears down the `MLflow` CR and any self-managed PostgreSQL / SeaweedFS infrastructure between backend suites so later suites do not inherit metadata from earlier ones. Reused post-upgrade resources remain preserved by default, but `CLEANUP_REUSED_RESOURCES=on_success` now lets callers keep failed runs for debugging while still cleaning up successful validation runs when `SKIP_CLEANUP=false`. `.github/workflows/upgrade-validation.yml` now runs `current-upgrade-pytest-validation`, which exercises the upgrade-tagged pytest machinery itself on the current build and keeps additive datasets such as `3.11` covered, alongside `seeded-upgrade-state-validation`, which seeds a `3.10.1` deployment, patches the running operator deployment and MLflow CR to the PR-built images, and reuses that upgraded state for `post_upgrade` validation. `.github/workflows/integration-tests.yml` continues to focus on the normal current-version integration matrix and now includes a Jenkins-like multi-backend row that runs multiple deployment options in a single `test-run.sh` invocation.

Normal harness-owned runs collect failure diagnostics before deleting their cluster-scoped `MLflow` CR after every suite, including the final suite. `INT` and `TERM` run the same idempotent cleanup before exiting so interrupted test containers cannot leave an instance that blocks `MLflowOperator` removal; explicit preserve/reuse flags retain their documented behavior.

In the seeded upgrade validation workflow, the historical source state now uses both a pinned `3.10.1` MLflow runtime image and the matching pinned historical operator image before the job patches the deployment in place to the PR-built operator/runtime pair for `post_upgrade`.
That seeded source state also restores the operator `config/rbac` tree from commit `38b88c61fa4acd0f35081e4d0685c10c0c5bea91` before pre-upgrade deployment, then reapplies the current operator manifests when the seeded validation job upgrades to the PR-built operator.

## Shift-left Upgrade Validation

This repository keeps a repo-local operator-chaos knowledge model at `chaos/knowledge/mlflow.yaml`. The accompanying `.github/workflows/operator-chaos.yml` pull request workflow validates that knowledge file, runs `operator-chaos preflight --local`, diffs the base and PR knowledge models, compares the checked-in MLflow CRD schema with `operator-chaos diff-crds`, previews upgrade scenarios with `operator-chaos simulate-upgrade --dry-run`, and fails the PR check when the knowledge or CRD diff reports breaking changes.

This workflow is intentionally offline and asset-focused. It fails fast when validation, command execution, or breaking knowledge/CRD changes are detected, and logs the relevant operator-chaos output directly in the failing step. Update `chaos/knowledge/mlflow.yaml` whenever the stable RHOAI controller topology, default chart-managed MLflow resources, or checked-in MLflow CRD shape changes in ways that should affect upgrade modeling.

This does not replace the existing runtime upgrade coverage. Continue to use `make test-e2e-upgrade` and the `upgrade-tests` job in `.github/workflows/upgrade-validation.yml` for live migration validation.
The [RHOAI MLflow Fork Testing Guide](docs/rhoai-mlflow-testing.md) also
captures how this offline gate fits alongside Jenkins shift-left and the live
runtime and upgrade workflows.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**MLflow pods fail to start with TLS errors**:
- Verify the OpenShift service-ca operator is running and functioning
- Check if the `mlflow-tls` secret was created automatically by the service-ca operator
- Ensure the Service has the `service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name` annotation set

**Cannot connect to MLflow**:
- Ensure the client presents a valid Kubernetes bearer token (kubernetes-auth)
- Verify the NetworkPolicy allows traffic from your source
- Check Service and Pod status: `kubectl get svc,pods -n <namespace>`

**Storage issues**:
- Ensure the PVC is bound: `kubectl get pvc -n <namespace>`
- For remote storage, verify database/S3 credentials are correct
- Check MLflow logs (the MLflow resource name is fixed to `mlflow`):
  ```bash
  kubectl logs -n <namespace> deployment/mlflow -c mlflow
  ```

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```
